        <h2>My name is Reilly. I am a self-taught costumer that has been recreating some of
        my most favorite characters through cosplay.</h2>
        <p>I have always found refuge in fictional characters. What began as dressing up for Halloween every
        year evolved into wearing handmade costumes to primary school as a way to tap
        into a given character&rsquo;s traits and incorporate what I admire about them, into my
        life. As an adult, I lean on the catharsis of cosplay as a respite from the difficulties
        of navigating adulthood. Cosplay has created a close-knit sense of community that
        spans continents, where we share crafting wisdom and strategies on how to bring
        our visions to life.</p>
        <p>This portfolio chronicles some of advancements in technique and form I have learned over the last five years, while 
        acting as a springboard for where I have yet to adventure! I have myriad independent projects I have worked on the last 
        few years that I would like to culminate into a portfolio to reflect my ability and growth as a costumer. The only 
        chronicling of my work I have done is disparate photography; as an artist, it is important to display my art!</p>
