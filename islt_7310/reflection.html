        <h2>Why I Enjoy What I Do</h2>
        <p>
            I believe that the way of bought perfection currently dominates the creator space. 
            While a time of deep grief and isolation, the COVID-19 pandemic&#39;s hand over our 
            consumption of digital media put the relatively closeted world of cosplay on full display. 
            While it is wonderful that so many people have taken a liking to this pastime, 
            the sheer access to pre-made costumes and cheap labor has taken over the art of 
            handmade imperfection.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cosplay is a tool for me to find my way back to myself. 
            Life is a difficult terrain to navigate, and putting on the façade of “having it all together”
             as an adult stirs up repression of the things that make our hearts happy. Some may 
             choose to believe the idea of recreationally dressing up as childish; for me, 
             it is a way to reconnect to my most authentic self: someone who loves fantastical 
             worlds and yearns to be immersed in them. 
        </p>

            <!--<figcaption>This person loves expressing themselves through cosplay!</figcaption>-->
        </figure>
        <p> 
            The purpose of my work is to throw accuracy off a cliff, and have fun doing so. 
            When I make these costumes, creating things as I perceive them, and not just exactly 
            how they look on-screen, has helped me cultivate my own brand of design. The quaint 
            feeling of something handmade, weaving love into each and every stitch is a powerful 
            feeling. To me, that experience means more than being a replica of any character. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Going forward, my biggest aim is to continue using cosplay as an artistic medium to 
            bring joy to others. Whether on the exhibition floor at a convention, or sharing 
            progress photos with my close friends, I know without a doubt that what I do makes 
            others &#8211; and myself &#8211; happy. Whatever the audience, however big the stage, I know 
            this is a lifelong passion. I cannot wait to see how we age together&#33; 
        </p>
