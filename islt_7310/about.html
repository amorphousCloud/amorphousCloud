        <h3>Hello, world!</h3>
        <p>My name is Reilly; I use they/them pronouns. I study Educational Gaming at the University of Missouri. In my free time as a college student and part time worker, I enjoy <b>numerous</b> hobbies.
        As a decade-long costume designer, my current design goal pertains to the new video game, “Baldur&apos;s Gate 3”. My husband and I are the doting parents of <em>two retired racing greyhounds</em>. We try to go on as many adventures with them as possible.
        When we are in relaxation mode, you&apos;ll find us watching any form of Star Wars media. I also enjoy the art of specialty coffee. My <em>secret entrepreneurial ambition</em> is to one day open my own coffee shop.
        I am always excited to try new things. Whatever life has in store for me, I welcome the change with open arms!</p>
        <p>I am currently working towards earning my Bachelor of Educational Studies, with a specialization in Educational Games and Simulations Design. I have an
        estimated graduation from the College of Education and Human Development in December 2024. I aspire to apply to the University of Missouri&rsquo;s Masters of
        Library and Information Science program; however, I may give myself some grace upon completion and let myself not feel pressured to earn another degree. I
        have been in college since 2013, where I was dual-enrolled as a high school junior. Immediately following high school graduation, I enlisted in the United
        States Air Force, where I served until 2022. Giving myself permission to fully be a student, I am disciplined and determined to finally graduate college.</p>
