        <h2><em>critical role</em> catch-all!</h2>
        <h3>caduceus clay</h3>
        <p>This project was my first incorporation of body paint into a costume, as well as the utilization of Photoshop to edit photographs. The costume had relatively little handmade crafting, though I pride myself on upcycling thrifted garments and minimizing consumption of new resources to make costumes. This costume was submitted to - and featured in - the Critical Role April 2021 Cosplay Gallery.</p>

        <h3>caleb widogast</h3>
        <p>Caleb was a fun test of makeup as well as enjoying what it felt like to have long hair! I returned from my deployment in 2020 with locks lovingly grown from closed barber shops and hair salons. While Caleb is what I would consider moreso a costest - cosplay test - I had a lot of fun being a moody, broody wizard.</p>

        <h3>veth brenatto</h3>
        <p>In the backyard of the apartment I used to live at was a beautiful magnolia tree. In 2021, I found that I had enough shiny bits and buttony bobs to make my own interpretation of the bauble-loving halfling-turned-goblin-turned-halfling, Veth. She loves pickpocketing rings, jewels, and buttons, and using what I had, I was able to try my hand at dressing as her as the magnolia pulls the heavy weight in the background. </p>

        <h3>yasha nydoorin</h3>
        <p>Though the photos don't particularly reveal it, I spent more money on Yasha than on any other costume. Her wig along is a sustainably-sourced human hair lace front wig. The components of her outfit came from a handful of local retailers and handmade Etsy retailers. Yasha was a guilty pleasure, but wearing her made me feel beautiful and powerful, just like her!</p>
