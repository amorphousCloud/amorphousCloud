        My name is Reilly. I am a self-taught costumer that has been recreating some of
        my most favorite characters through cosplay.
        I have always found refuge in fictional characters. What began as dressing up for Halloween every
        year evolved into wearing handmade costumes to primary school as a way to tap
        into a given character&rsquo;s traits and incorporate what I admire about them, into my
        life. As an adult, I lean on the catharsis of cosplay as a respite from the difficulties
        of navigating adulthood. Cosplay has created a close-knit sense of community that
        spans continents, where we share crafting wisdom and strategies on how to bring
        our visions to life.
        This portfolio chronicles some of advancements in technique and form I have learned over the last five years, while 
        acting as a springboard for where I have yet to adventure! I have myriad independent projects I have worked on the last 
        few years that I would like to culminate into a portfolio to reflect my ability and growth as a costumer. The only 
        chronicling of my work I have done is disparate photography; as an artist, it is important to display my art!

        Hello, world!
        My name is Reilly; I use they/them pronouns.
        I study Educational Gaming at the University of Missouri.
        In my free time as a college student and part time worker, I enjoy <b>numerous</b> hobbies.
        As a decade-long costume designer, my current design goal pertains to the new video game, “Baldur&apos;s Gate 3”.
        My husband and I are the doting parents of <em>two retired racing greyhounds</em>. We try to go on as many adventures with them as possible.
        When we are in relaxation mode, you&apos;ll find us watching any form of Star Wars media.
        I also enjoy the art of specialty coffee. My <em>secret entrepreneurial ambition</em> is to one day open my own coffee shop.
        I am always excited to try new things. Whatever life has in store for me, I welcome the change with open arms!
        I am currently working towards earning my Bachelor of Educational Studies, with
        a specialization in Educational Games and Simulations Design. I have an
        estimated graduation from the College of Education and Human Development in
        December 2024. I aspire to apply to the University of Missouri&rsquo;s Masters of
        Library and Information Science program; however, I may give myself some
        grace upon completion and let myself not feel pressured to earn another degree. I
        have been in college since 2013, where I was dual-enrolled as a high school
        junior. Immediately following high school graduation, I enlisted in the United
        States Air Force, where I served until 2022. Giving myself permission to fully be
        a student, I am disciplined and determined to finally graduate college.
